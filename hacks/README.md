# Socket.py Patch for Chainlit

## Background

Chainlit is a powerful tool for building chat-based AI applications. However, there's a known issue with the `socket.py` file in the Chainlit package that can cause problems with certain functionalities, particularly related to WebSocket connections and event handling.

## The Hack

To address this issue, we've implemented a temporary solution using a patch file and the `env` `Makefile` target. This hack allows us to modify the `socket.py` file in the installed Chainlit package without altering the original source code.

### patch_socket.py

The `patch_socket.py` script is designed to modify the `socket.py` file in the Chainlit package. It makes specific changes to improve the handling of WebSocket connections and event processing. The script is located in the `hacks` directory of our project.

### Makefile Target

The `env` target in our `Makefile` includes a step to apply the patch:

```bash
@$(PYTHON) hacks/patch_socket.py
```

This line runs the `patch_socket.py` script after installing the project dependencies and setting up the environment.

### Why This Hack is Necessary

- Compatibility: The patch ensures that our project works correctly with the current version of Chainlit, addressing [known issues](https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit/pull/1364) in the socket.py file.
- Non-invasive: By using a patch, we avoid modifying the installed package directly, making it easier to manage and update Chainlit in the future.
- Temporary Solution: This hack serves as a temporary fix while waiting for the Chainlit maintainers to address the issue in a future release.
- Improved Functionality: The patch enhances the WebSocket handling and event processing, which is crucial for the proper functioning of our chat-based AI application.

### Future Considerations

While this hack is currently necessary for our project to function correctly with Chainlit, it's important to note that this is a temporary solution. We should:
- Keep an eye on Chainlit updates and remove this hack once the issue is resolved in the official package.
- [x] Communicate with the Chainlit maintainers about the issue and our workaround.
- [x] Contribute [a fix](https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit/pull/1364) to the Chainlit project.
- [x] By implementing this hack, we ensure that our project can leverage Chainlit's capabilities while mitigating known issues in the current version.
